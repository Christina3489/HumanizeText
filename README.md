# HumanizeText

Built an intelligent Streamlit-based tool that helps content creators convert AI-generated content into authentic, human-like writing.

This project is specifically designed to assist content writers in producing natural content that aligns with human tone, context, and flow — ideal for platforms that flag AI-written material.

Key Features:

1. Advanced prompt tuning to humanize tone, rhythm, and phrasing
2. Converts robotic or repetitive AI outputs into fluent, relatable content
3. Significantly reduces AI-detection scores to 0%
4. Powered by OpenAI GPT, PyTorch, and LangChain for intelligent rewriting
5. Clean Streamlit UI for real-time rephrasing and result preview
